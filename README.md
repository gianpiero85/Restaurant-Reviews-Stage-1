#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, *Stage One**, I took a static design that was provided by Udacity and converted it in a responsive and accessible for screen reader use.  I also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.
